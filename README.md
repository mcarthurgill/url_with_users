url_with_users
==============
This is a fun little app that is similar to bitly.

If a url is entered into the input field, a shortened link is created that actually links to the original url

Steps to run:
-------------

clone the repo

cd into the repo

run bundle install

run rake db:create

run rake db:migrate

run shotgun

then go to localhost:9393
